The chat for project 1. Using chat for help. 
Do not give me the answer, don not write any code and only help me with the logic of this prompt. 
 
Unit

attackPower: int

hitPoints: int ( keep between 0 and max )

range: double ( default to sqrt 2 )

xPosition: int

yPosition: int

team: string

isAlive: boolean

 

function:

virutal attack(Unit* target)

if the unit is within range ( distance between 2 points ), see if the units team is someone they should attack

'us' fights 'them' and 'chaotic'

'them' fights 'us' and 'chaotic'

'chaotic' fights everyone

when units attack, reduce the target's hitPoints by the attackers attackPower

virutal move()

 

1st class: Infantry - extends Unit

attackPower = 5

hitPoints = 5

move either x+/- or y+/- on a given move, no more than 5 units

 

2nd class Artillery - extends Unit

range = 10

attackPower = 10

hitPoints = 1

move 1 x or y at a time

 

3rd class Calvary - extends Unit

range = 5

attackPower = 5

hitPoints = 10

move 10 x or y at a time

 

4th class Captain - extends infantry unit

attackPower = 1

hitPoints = 20

change the behavior of attack to rally a friendly unit

if the target is within range and on their team, they restore all their hit points

Here's a breakdown of the logic you'll need to implement the classes for your pretend game.

1. Class: Unit
This will be the base class for all the unit types. It will store common properties (such as attackPower, hitPoints, etc.) and have the attack and move functions, which other classes will override as needed.

Properties:

attackPower: Determines how much damage the unit deals.
hitPoints: The health of the unit.
range: The effective range for attacks (defaults to sqrt(2)).
xPosition and yPosition: The unit's current position on the grid.
team: The team the unit belongs to.
isAlive: Boolean flag that checks if the unit is alive.
Functions:

attack(target: Unit): This checks if the target is within range and if they are an enemy unit. If the conditions are met, it reduces the target's hit points by the attacker's attack power.
move(): This function is virtual and will be implemented by subclasses. The unit will change its position on the grid.
2. Class: Infantry (extends Unit)
Properties:
attackPower = 5
hitPoints = 5
range = sqrt(2) (defaults to this value)
Functions:
move(): Moves 1 unit at a time either in the x or y direction, but no more than 5 units in total.
3. Class: Artillery (extends Unit)
Properties:
attackPower = 10
hitPoints = 1
range = 10
Functions:
move(): Moves 1 unit at a time in the x or y direction.
4. Class: Calvary (extends Unit)
Properties:
attackPower = 5
hitPoints = 10
range = 5
Functions:
move(): Moves 10 units at a time in the x or y direction.
5. Class: Captain (extends Infantry)
Properties:
attackPower = 1 (the Captain is more of a support unit than a damage dealer)
hitPoints = 20
Functions:
attack(target: Unit): Overridden to restore the target unit’s hit points if the target is an ally (same team) and within range. If the unit is an enemy, it behaves like a standard infantry attack.
Logic to implement:
Attack Function: The attack() function should first calculate the distance between the units using the Euclidean distance formula (distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)).
Attack Target Validation: The attack should only happen if the target is an enemy, determined by comparing the teams (us vs them, chaotic vs everyone).
Movement: Units should move in the appropriate way:
Infantry: Move 1 step in either x or y direction, no more than 5 units.
Artillery: Move 1 step in either x or y direction.
Calvary: Move 10 steps in either x or y direction.
Captain: Same as Infantry, but with special attack logic for rallying allies.
Example attack scenarios:
Infantry attacks another Infantry if it's within range and they’re enemies.
Artillery will attack from a longer range (10 units).
Calvary can move fast but has a shorter range for attacks.
Captain will heal allies (i.e., restore hit points) if they are within range and on the same team.
Additional Notes:
In the attack() function, when checking for enemies, make sure to validate the team according to the rules:
'us' fights 'them' and 'chaotic'
'them' fights 'us' and 'chaotic'
'chaotic' fights everyone.
With this logic, you can structure the classes with inheritance. The Unit class is the parent class, and the others (Infantry, Artillery, Calvary, and Captain) extend Unit while overriding specific behaviors like move() and attack().

Does this breakdown make sense for you to start implementing?

okay got thank you, the im having trouble with the file on github, i just need to fetch, then commit or??
ChatGPT said:
No problem! It sounds like you're working with a GitHub repository and you're having trouble with fetching and committing. Here's a simple guide for what you need to do:

Steps to Fetch, Commit, and Push in Git:
Fetch the latest changes: This updates your local repository with changes from the remote repository, but it doesn't change your working directory or staging area.

bash
Copy
git fetch
This command will download new commits from the remote repository but won't modify your working directory. It simply ensures you have the latest changes.

Check for any changes or modifications: If you want to see what’s changed since your last commit (e.g., files that are different or files you’ve modified), use:

bash
Copy
git status
Stage your changes: After making changes to your files, you'll need to "stage" them, meaning you're telling Git which files you want to include in your next commit.

To stage all changes:

bash
Copy
git add .
Or to stage specific files:

bash
Copy
git add <filename>
Commit your changes: Once you’ve staged the changes, you need to commit them. When committing, provide a message describing what changes were made:

bash
Copy
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Push your changes to GitHub: After committing locally, you need to push your changes to the remote repository (GitHub).

bash
Copy
git push
If this is your first time pushing to a branch, you might need to specify the branch name like this:

bash
Copy
git push origin <branch-name>
(Optional) Pull the latest changes before pushing (to avoid conflicts): It's a good practice to pull the latest changes from the remote repository before pushing to ensure you're not overwriting others' work. You can use:

bash
Copy
git pull
This will fetch the changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch.

In Summary:
git fetch: Updates your local copy with changes from GitHub.
git status: Check for modified files.
git add .: Stage all changes.
git commit -m "message": Commit the changes with a message.
git push: Push the changes to GitHub.
Does this help clear up your workflow?
